The measure comes as the number of daily new infections has mostly increased by double digits over the past two weeks, sharply down from triple-digit growth in late August following a holiday and a mass rally that took place in central Seoul.
The government said it has decided to relax the social distancing measures considering the negative impact that stronger measures have had on people's sentiment and the domestic economy.
"We have returned to Level 1, though not completely, almost two months after Liberation Day (Aug. 15)," Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said in a regular government COVID-19 response meeting earlier in the day, urging the public to follow various measures.
The country first adopted the Level 2 distancing measures in Seoul and the surrounding Gyeonggi Province on Aug. 16 and Incheon on Aug. 19. It was expanded nationwide on Aug. 23.
