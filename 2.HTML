<p>
South Korea on Monday began implementing the lowest level of its social distancing guidelines following a slowdown in new cases in recent weeks, but the country remains vigilant over a possible resurgence of COVID-19.
Under the decision, the country eased the previous Level 2 social distancing measures to Level 1 in the three-tier system across the country.
